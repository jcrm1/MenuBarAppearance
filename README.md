This app is the successor to the Java-based StatusBarAppearanceToggle. It was much more useful before Control Center came to macOS, so I understand that it's a bit odd that I made this for macOS 13.0 or newer. I think it looks nice on my menu bar, though, so I'm uploading it here in case anyone else wants it.
